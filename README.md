> ### I’m @amnscott
>   - I began periodic Git/Github self-study in 2022
>   - My self-study goals are:
>     - better support to software developers as a Linux sys-admin &mdash; having basic Git/Github skills allows better dialog with developers
>     - use Git features for sys-admin team purposes, to manage products (e.g., scripts, configuration files, team documenation)
>     - post Technical Writer/Course Developer sample documents
>     - post code snippets or working scripts (e.g., Ansible, BASH, Python3)
>   - I’m not yet looking to collaborate on much at this time &mdash; but soon!
