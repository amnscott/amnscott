- 👋 I’m @amnscott
- 👀 I’m interested in better supporting Agile SW Development teams as a Linux sys-admin. I want some Git/Github skills to have better dialog with developers, and to use Git features for sys-admin team purposes as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, Python3, Ansible, and associated tools, mostly in pursuit of automation and configuration management techniques.
- 💞️ I’m not yet looking to collaborate on much at this time - until no longer a nube on these topics.
