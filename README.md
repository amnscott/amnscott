> ### I’m @amnscott
>   - I began periodic Git/Github self-study in 2022
>   - My self-study goals are:
>     - I wish to better support software developers as a Linux sys-admin. Having some Git/Github skills allows better dialog with developers at times.
>     - I wish to use Git features for sys-admin team purposes, to manage products (e.g. scripts, team documenation...)
>     - I wish to start posting sample Technical Writing work soon 
>     - I wish to start posting sample code snippets or working scripts (e.g. Python3, Ansible...)
>   - I’m not yet looking to collaborate on much at this time - until no longer a nube on these topics.
