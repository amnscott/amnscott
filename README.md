- 👋 I’m @amnscott
- 👀 I’m interested in better supporting Agile SW Development teams as a Linux sys-admin. I want Git/Github skills to have better dialog with developers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3 and Ansible and associated tools, mostly in pursuit of automation and configuration management techniques.
- 💞️ I’m not yet looking to collaborate on much at this time - until no longer a nube.
