> ### I’m @amnscott
>   - Work experiences led me to advocate DevSecOps principles within software development environments in 2021
>     - Continued work experiences led me to to advocate "Documentation as Code"
>     - Therefore, Git/GitHub self-study began &mdash; it is interesting and fun
>     
>   - I intend to create (am creating) repositories containing:
>     - Technical Writer/Course Developer sample documents
>     - Code snippets or working scripts (e.g., Ansible, BASH, Python3)
>
>   - Git knowledge also allows me to:
>     - better support software developers as a Linux system administrator
>     - use Git for sys-admin team purposes, to manage: scripts, configuration files, documentation
