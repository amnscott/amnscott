> ### I’m @amnscott
>   - Once experiencing and advocating DevSecOps principles within software development environments in 2021, I also became a "Documentation as Code" advocate
>     - Git/GitHub self-study began &mdash; it is interesting and fun
>     
>   - I intend to create (am creating) repos containing:
>     - Technical Writer/Course Developer sample documents
>     - Code snippets or working scripts (e.g., Ansible, BASH, Python3)
>
>   - Git knowledge also allows me to:
>     - better support software developers as a Linux sys-admin
>     - use Git for internal sys-admin team purposes, to manage scripts, configuration files, team documentation...
